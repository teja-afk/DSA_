# 🚀 DSA in C++

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository in **C++**!  
This repo is a collection of my personal DSA practice and learning journey — including coding problems, explanations, and optimized solutions using C++.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ Solved problems from platforms like LeetCode, CodeStudio (CodeHelp), GFG, etc.
- 🧠 Topics covered: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP, and more.
- 🧪 Optimized C++ code with comments for clarity.
- 🗂️ Properly organized topic-wise folders for easy navigation.
